				<h2>Ford Mustang and It's history</h2>
				<p>
					Epitomising the American automotive dream, the first Ford Mustang rolled off the production line on the 9th March 1964. Named for a World War II fighter plane, the Mustang was one of the first vehicles that came to be known as a “pony car”.

				<h2>What is Mustang famous for ?</h2>
				<p>
					“It was a preproduction car, supposed to be a showroom model for display” before sales began March 17, 1964, said Matt Anderson, curator of transportation at the museum.
				</p>

				<p>
					Ford sold more than 400,000 Mustangs within its first year of production, far exceeding sales expectations. The Mustang was conceived as a “working man's Thunderbird,” according to Ford.

					In the early 1960s, Lee Iacocca, vice president and general manager of Ford, envisioned a sporty youth-market car based on the compact Falcon. Developed in record time on a shoe-string budget, Ford introduced the 1965 Mustang at the World's Fair on April 17, 1964, to instant acclaim.

				<h2>Success</h2>
				<p>
					The success of the Mustang launch led to multiple competitors from other American manufacturers, including the Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird (1967), AMC Javelin (1968), and Dodge Challenger (1970). The Mustang also had an effect on designs of coupes worldwide, leading to the marketing of the Toyota Celica and Ford Capri in the United States (the latter, by Lincoln-Mercury). The Mercury Cougar was launched in 1967 as a unique-bodied higher-trim alternative to the Mustang; during the 1970s, it included more features and was marketed as a personal luxury car.

					The 2020 model year saw the re-introduction of the GT500. The 2020 GT500 includes a hand-built 5.2-liter "Predator" aluminum-alloy V8 engine with a 2.65-liter roots-type supercharger. The Shelby GT500 produces 760 hp (567 kW; 771 PS) and 625 lb⋅ft (847 N⋅m) of torque. The GT350 was discontinued at the end of the 2020 model year.
